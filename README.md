## About this book

The first and best overview of Angular 2 on the marketâ€”this guide gathers together everything there is to know about Angular 2 and groups it in intuitive sections. No hunting through confusing documentation or scrambling piecemeal to figure out how things work together; this book is your detailed map of every feature and its use cases.

The author has done all the hard work of fitting everything Angular 2 means for developers together for you, making this book the quickest way to learn Angular 2 from scratch. This is an inexpensive, yet invaluable addition to every Angular user's toolkit to refer back to time and again. It's great for newcomers to Angular who will learn best through clear explanations and definitions of concepts.
