# 1: Creating our first component in Angular 2

**Warning:** Our *Angular 2 Essentials* book, encompassing the code examples available here, is still in Alpha state and therefore the samples provided herein may be subject to change without prior notice.

## Description

We kickstart our journey into Angular by building our very first component, which is the bread and butter of all Angular 2 applications. Angular 2 components conform the bricks of all web applications and by the end of this chapter we will have a fully functional web widget harnessing the power of Angular.

## Topics covered

This chapter exposes the user to the code paradigm of Angular components, based on ES6 classes decorated with annotations. Prior to that we will guide the user through the vast ocean of tooling available for working on TypeScript-baed projects.

## Skills learned

* How to setup a workspace with support for Angular 2 and TypeScript.
* Leverage automated build tools like Gulp to help accomplish the above.
* Enhance our IDE of choice (Sublime, Atom, [https://code.visualstudio.com/](Visual Studio Code)) with TypeScript code visual helpers.
* Build our very first Angular 2 component and render it on an HTML page.
* Format our component output with pipes.
* Bootstrap our newly created component.
